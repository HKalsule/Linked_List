# Linked_List
They're like the building blocks of more complex data structures. Imagine a chain of elements, each holding a value and a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence.

Here are some key points about linked lists:

Nodes: The basic units of a linked list are nodes. Each node contains some data (the value you want to store) and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

Head: The first node in the linked list is called the head. It's like the starting point of your chain.

Tail: The last node in the linked list is called the tail. Its link points to null or nullptr, indicating the end of the list.

Singly Linked Lists: In a singly linked list, each node points to the next one, forming a unidirectional chain.

Doubly Linked Lists: In a doubly linked list, each node has links to both the next and the previous nodes, creating a bidirectional chain. This allows for easier traversal in both directions but requires more memory.
